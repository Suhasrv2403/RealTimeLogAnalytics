# ðŸ§  Real-Time Log Analytics Pipeline

This project implements a real-time log analytics pipeline using modern data engineering tools:  
**Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Airflow**, and **Python**.

Logs are ingested from a simulated log producer, processed in real time using Spark, indexed in Elasticsearch, and visualized via Kibana dashboards. Logs are archived to S3 using Airflow.
